# Visualisations
This repository contains code to create visualisations for analysing player performance using Statsbomb data, such shot, pass and heatmaps. These visualisations enable users to gain insights into player behavior, movement, and effectiveness on the pitch, making them valuable for performance analysis and scouting.

## Key Features

Consistency: All visualisations follow a unified theme for readability and visual appeal.

Customisability: Easily switch between players, matches, or seasons for tailored analysis.

Detailed Visualisations: Use of shapes, colors, and sizes to display event details (e.g., xG values, outcomes).

## Examples
